## Benchy

A standard 3D Benchy. See https://www.3dbenchy.com/ for more information.

## one_layer_100x30

A 100x30mm rectangle with a single layer height. This is useful to check the first layer height and bed adhesion. You could use live z-layer calibration to tune the first layer.

## one_later_20x20

A 20x20mm rectangle with a single layer height. Useful for a very quick check of the first layer.

## cylinder_hollow_100x8

A 100mm heigth cylinder with a wall thickness of 8mm. This is useful to detect y- or x-crashes.

## stringing_test_cylinders

3 narrow cylinders in a row with a small and a large gap. This is useful to check for stringing.
